# Simple-Shopping-App
As of now this is a pretty simple looking application, but the code behind in it really cool and in depth in my opinion. This application use text files for two different things. The first thing they are used for is adding and deleting store items and prices. You can seamlessly add and delete an item or even change the name of the item that is on the text file. The other use of text files is for the admin logins, when you go to the admin login page and type in information it will compare it to the list and if the line and the line below it arent matching to the user input it wont log you in if they do match you will be successfully logged in. Here are some screenshots from the admin side of the program:
